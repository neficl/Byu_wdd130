                Everything we've lived together in recent years is based on love, dedication, respect, and trust. People
                always
                say “Your connection is amazing” YES and this is only possible because, in addition to shurastey being
                my
                companion dog, he is my life partner, he is always with me in everything I do but especially in the
                places where
                I somehow he'll feel good. My well-being in taking you with me to all the roles has to be equivalent to
                your
                well-being of being in this place.

                Today we visited @summitov and it was an amazing experience, and shurastey was the first dog to go
                there, but
                the most amazing thing is realizing that you were fine walking on a glass walkway at a height of over
                400 meters
                and all that because you were feeling safe because you were with me by your side!
