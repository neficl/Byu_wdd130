                <h2>Just a Dog</h2>
                <p>
                    "From time to time, people tell me, “lighten up, it’s just a dog,” or, “that’s a lot of money for
                    just a dog.” They don’t understand the distance traveled, the time spent, or the costs involved for
                    “just a dog.”

                    Some of my proudest moments have come about with “just a dog.” Many hours have passed and my only
                    company was “just a dog,” but I did not once feel slighted.

                    Some of my saddest moments have been brought about by “just a dog,” and in those days of darkness,
                    the gentle touch of “just a dog” gave me comfort and reason to overcome the day.

                    If you, too, think it’s “just a dog,” then you will probably understand phases like “just a friend,”
                    “just a sunrise,” or “just a promise.” “Just a dog” brings into my life the very essence of
                    friendship, trust, and pure unbridled joy. “Just a dog” brings out the compassion and patience that
                    make me a better person.

                    Because of “just a dog” I will rise early, take long walks and look longingly to the future. So for
                    me and folks like me, it’s not “just a dog” but an embodiment of all the hopes and dreams of the
                    future, the fond memories of the past, and the pure joy of the moment.

                    “Just a dog” brings out what’s good in me and diverts my thoughts away from myself and the worries
                    of the day.

                    I hope that someday they can understand that it’s not “just a dog” but the thing that gives me
                    humanity and keeps me from being “just a human.”

                    So the next time you hear the phrase “just a dog.” just smile, because they “just don’t understand.”

                <h2>The man and The dog</h2>
                <p>
                    "A dog doesn't care about your salary, doesn't care about your clothes, doesn't take a bank statement,
                    doesn't know what money is, travels abroad, and doesn't even want to live in a mansion. He just wants
                    your affection and, who knows, a little corner inside your heart.
                    I've never seen a dog clearing a forest, mistreating its planet and what little it has left. It does not
                    pollute the river or sea, nor will it ever march to start a war, for money, ambition, racism, religion,
                    or a piece of land. I doubt, I doubt whether a dog is involved in a monthly allowance, bathing in car
                    washes or barking in denunciation, oration in a square against its own race. The reason, I beg you,
                    there are no animals investigated, much less condemned in the kennels of Congress...
                    Without a diploma, without study, he is a master, he is a teacher of the most beautiful discipline: the
                    matter of love. And man, even though he studied, lives being flunked and doesn't learn the lesson, which
                    is so simple to understand, we just need to understand, how does a dog live... A life, a life that is so
                    brief, so maybe the rush, the urgency of loving, since loving is what matters, if you give without
                    wanting to change, be happy even with little. And suffering humanity, even so, it doesn't understand, it
                    fights, but it doesn't learn what a dog is born knowing: that love has 4 letters and, of course, 4 paws,
                    it doesn't differentiate between gold or a piece of tin, it doesn't speak, it doesn't know how to read,
                    but says everything to you with the power of a look, so pure and so loyal, has the special gift of
                    always forgiving us...
                    That's why I'll never understand the pretension of a man who claims to be smarter than a dog. In our
                    society, infested with vanity and banal feelings, for man to grow he would need to be born just like
                    animals."
