                When we are going to adopt a dog, we often simply think about how to feed it, and keep it clean and
                safe.
                But
                the truth is that a dog needs much more than that. After all, he is much more than a simple animal that
                needs to
                survive in the middle of a dense and dangerous forest. He is an animal that needs a home, a family, and
                lots of
                love. This need exists and you need to fill it. We'll teach you how to do it!
