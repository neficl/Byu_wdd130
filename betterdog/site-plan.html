      George Eliot once said, "Animals are very pleasant friends - they don't ask questions, they don't criticize." In
      addition to the ability to create attachment and an emotional connection with humans and other animals, the
      intelligence of dogs is something that is also extremely widespread and exploited, transforming dogs into true
      superheroes in the eyes of the physically and intellectually disabled – who can benefit greatly from the help of a
      four-legged friend to gain more independence and even motivation.

      <h3>Touching Stories</h3>
      <p>
        Everything we've lived together in recent years is based on love, dedication, respect, and trust. People always
        say “Your connection is amazing” YES and this is only possible because, in addition to shurastey being my
        companion dog, he is my life partner, he is always with me in everything I do but especially in the places where
        I somehow he'll feel good. My well-being in taking you with me to all the roles has to be equivalent to your
        well-being of being in this place.

        Today we visited @summitov and it was an amazing experience, and shurastey was the first dog to go there, but
        the most amazing thing is realizing that you were fine walking on a glass walkway at a height of over 400 meters
        and all that because you were feeling safe because you were with me by your side!

      <h3>FAQ</h3>
      <p>
        When we are going to adopt a dog, we often simply think about how to feed it, and keep it clean and safe. But
        the truth is that a dog needs much more than that. After all, he is much more than a simple animal that needs to
        survive in the middle of a dense and dangerous forest. He is an animal that needs a home, a family, and lots of
        love. This need exists and you need to fill it. We'll teach you how to do it!
