                "The dog is that type of animal more clothed in the soul than in fur." It is amazing to know that four little
                legs are capable of demonstrating the power of the verb to love.
                On this website, you will find a friend who will love you more than himself. Through the compelling stories, you
                will be able to save animal lives.

            <p class="step2">
                George Eliot once said, "Animals are very pleasant friends - they don't ask questions, they don't criticize." In
                addition to the ability to create attachment and an emotional connection with humans and other animals, the
                intelligence of dogs is something that is also extremely widespread and exploited, transforming dogs into true
                superheroes in the eyes of the physically and intellectually disabled – who can benefit greatly from the help of a
                four-legged friend to gain more independence and even motivation.
