                <p>Hi guys! My name is Néfi Leite, I'm 21 years old until Monday. I'm from Brasília, but I live in João
                    Pessoa, in the beautiful northeast of Brazil. I love going to the beach, watching movies, playing
                    soccer, and going out with my friends.</p>
                <p>It's been a year and three months since I went from my mission, Brazil Florianópolis (2019-2021).
                    Even studying computer engineer, here in Brazil, I decided to follow my sister's example and join
                    BYU Pathway to improve my English and learn more! So continued my degree at BYU Idaho, I hope to
                    physically complete my university in Brazil, and the same will happen in the United States in the
                    future.</p>
                <p>I have to be honest, I was running away to learn HTML and CSS. Even having faced challenges in
                    university and focusing on other programming languages, I'm here to learn from you. It is a pleasure
                    to meet them!</p>
